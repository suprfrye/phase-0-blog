    <h2>It's All Relative</h2>

		Alright. So, this week we got into front-end development basics; HTML, CSS, and the process flow for building a website.HTML is pretty straightforward as the element tag names spell out what they should be used for, but styling the page is a litte trickier. In particular, CSS positions, relative, absolute, fixed, and static, can be a bit troublesome. Let's try and get them pinned down.
		</p>
		<p>
		All elements by default are set to a position of static. Static elements follow the normal flow of the page. Relative elements initially follow the normal flow of the page, but can be moved, in reference to this initial position, by right, left, top, and bottom declarations. Absolute elements do not follow the normal flow of the page. They are positioned in relation to their containing block (that does not have a position of static). Fixed elements are also taken out of the normal flow of the page. These elements are positioned relative to the browser view. So, regardless of where you scroll it will keep its position.
		</p>
		<p>
		This all sounds simple. If only moving elements around were actually just as simply done.
