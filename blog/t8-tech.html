        This week we delved into front-end programming with JavaScript! It was a surprising, yet welcomed change. Our time with Ruby certainly helped out with learning the basics of JavaScript. Ruby and JavaScript share the data types, strings, integers, floats, arrays, and booleans, have similar syntax when expressing these data types, and share in a few built-in methods that are invoked using dot notation.

		One, big difference between Ruby and JavaScript comes in the use and implementation of objects. In Ruby, objects are instances of a class. You can define a class using the keyword "class" followed by a block of code detailing the behavior of the class. To gain access to this behavior, calling new on the class, an instance of the class is initialized and assigned to a variable. This variable is an object of type "className".
