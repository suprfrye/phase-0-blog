	I absolutely love pairing. Pairing allows you to see a problem from a different perspective and solve it from in a different way. Through pairing I've become familiar with methods that I wasn't aware of or either not clear of their syntax and possible implementation.

	In pairing the social aspect is just as rewarding, if not more. Pairing is really our only interaction with one another. It has been such a pleasure to get to know people in my cohort. I have been able to share my expectations, my trepidations, and just gain an overall feeling of comraderie.

    I haven't yet received feedback from my pair programming. But, giving feedback initially was troublesome. I have at times found myself searching for something constructive to say so that my partner gets a chance to improve. Once I started rating more feedback I got a good feel for what was expected and what wasn's helpful.
