        One semester in college when I went to get my 3 month transportation pass, my student ID reported that it was not current. I went to the Card Center to get things straightened out. When I informed the desk attendant of my predicament, he said that I would have to either find my current ID or buy a new one. I then informed him that this was my current ID as I just exchanged it using their wear and tear policy. He said there was nothing he could do because the system says it is not current, etc. I explained everything again to him, and when he repeated the same thing I asked to speak to someone else. By this time I was already getting frustrated. I repeated my predicament again to the new attendant and she repeated they same thing, the computer was right (as it was a computer) and I had to pay $20 for a new card. I tried to explain that, I had to go through something similar this week as I had been removed from my minor by the computer and manually added back by my advisor. Hinting at the unique situation and that computers can sometimes be wrong. It was just a hopeless situation, as I saw that they did not want to budge.
		</p>

        I was pretty upset, I even said "a-duh" to the first attendant when he said that the card I pulled out for visual representation during my explanation was not my ID. I realized afterward that I felt insignificant. When I entered the office, with no other customers, I was not greeted, I was not acknowledged. I also felt that I was not being understood, nor was there an attempt at understanding. I felt that my situation was not individualized and that as a student, and in their eyes just another "kid", I was not taken seriously. I felt dismissed and unimportant. I was also already upset from waiting in line for hours for the pass, getting to the counter, not being able to get my pass, and then walking to the other side of campus and not getting anything resolved.
		</p>
        <p>
        If I could go back, I would not have gone into the Card Center right away. I would have taken a walk or engaged in a distraction to change my mood. This would have allowed me to overlook the poor customer service. As I typically do, I would have been able to take a step back and keep everything light instead of being so emotionally involved because of my rising frustration. I also would have ended the conversation earlier and with a thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
        From this situation, I learned that I need to assess my emotional state before engaging in a situation. I also need to understand that not everyone will value me as a person, customer, employee, etc., but I can't allow others' treatment define my actions.
