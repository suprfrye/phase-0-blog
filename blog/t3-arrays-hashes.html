		Need a way to store your objects? Well, here's a couple of options: arrays and hashes. Both collections can hold a bunch of objects, but which one should you use? Let's take a closer look.
		</p>
		<p>
		Arrays are ordered collections of objects, meaning you can store strings, numbers, arrays, hashes, boolean values, or any other type of object and access them by location (index). Grocery lists, to-do lists, Pie eating contest results, all lend themselves well to arrays. Hashes are collections of objects stored as a key/value pair. Instead of locating objects by index, you use the key to access the value. If you were building a dating site, a good way to store user profiles would be in a hash, matching keys (height, age, perfect_date, favorites) with values (66in, 29, "A dinner by candlelight.", ['There Will Be Blood', 'Lilo and Stitch', 'The Five Heartbeats']).

		Arrays and hashes are both great options when looking for data storage. When choosing which to use remember that if order matters, arrays are the way to go, while if you have data to associate with another piece of data, key/value pairing, hashes are what you need.
