      Dev Bootcamp just keeps getting cooler. Shereef is so transparent in the Fireside Chat. The background he provided in how Dev Bootcamp developed was so pertinent to the subjects we're covering in Week 1, it was like witnessing a living cycle of version control. He walked through the creation of Dev Bootcamp, the changes committed as a result of the experience of each passing cohort, and the Phase 4 branch they're experimenting with.

      Dev Bootcamp seems like the ideal learning environment where your attitude determines your experience and growth as well as that of your cohort and the evolution of Dev Bootcamp. I am so excited to be a part of DBC Sea Lions. Coincidentally, my sister asked me last night if I was excited yet, knowing that I am still 7 weeks away from being on-site. After watching the video, I am so motivated to delve into more resources and continue to expand upon the Phase 0 foundation. Shereef was so encouraging. Being a part of such an intense learning environment automatically inserts the pressure of excelling and an air of competition. But, Shereef has succeeded in continuing the message of reconfiguring this focus towards ownership of your journey at Dev Bootcamp and self-improvement.

      I am very nervous to come into an environment where part of the focus is on learning and practicing the skills necessary to be socially and emotionally adept. I am also nervous about the challenge of bringing my best self everyday for 9 weeks to get the most out of Dev Bootcamp. But, I am also very excited to witness the possibilities within me and the opportunites that will open before me.
