      Most of the questions I have searched for in Google have yielded helpful results. There have been a few that did not. For our first week of JavaScript in DBC's Phase 0, there was a challenge where we had to recreate a web based game. I searched and researched for a way to render JavaScript in html and to use JavaScript to manipulate html elements. The results I got were so scattered and not specific to my challenge because I wasn't specific in describing what I wanted to do in JavaScript.
      </p>

      Here is what has worked for me in the past when troubleshooting errors and solution code. 
      <ul>
        <li>Including the language. Ex: <em>JavaScript</em> constructor function syntax</li>
        <li>Specifying the data type. Ex: Iterate through each <em>hash</em> key value in Ruby</li>
        <li>Include full error message. Ex: TypeError cannot read property nodeName of null JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      It helps that Google has suggestions when you start to type in your question. This has come in handy when I was at a loss for keywords to help clarify my search. I have been fortunate in that either my initial search has yielded helpful results or that someone else in my cohort has asked a similar question in Google+. I am a little more nervous about asking questions in person. I think it's harder to follow someone's speech, there aren't points of references to return to, you can't proofread read the words as they're coming out for clarity, and there's no autocomplete. In that case, it'll be beneficial for me to make notes before approaching a instructor/mentor.
