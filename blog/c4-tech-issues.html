    <h2>Get Ahead of the Gap</h2>

		Technology is ever evolving. One of the issues facing the tech industry is a lack of qualified individuals to fill vacancies. 
		</p>
		<p>
		To combat this lapse in the skills, companies should incorporate a new position whose sole responsibility is to research trends in the industry and prepare the company to incorporate these trends. This can mean training in house employees in the new technology, recruiting new employees and having them go through training, or colaborating with universities to recruit apprentices and train them in the desired technology. With the last option, you also provide marketable experience for college students in a high in demand technology.
