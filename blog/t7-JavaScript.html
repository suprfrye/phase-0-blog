    <h2>Javascript: Objects with no Class</h2>
    <h4>Saturday, February 7, 2015</h4>

        This week we delved into front-end programming with JavaScript! It was a surprising, yet welcomed change. Our time with Ruby certainly helped out with learning the basics of JavaScript. Ruby and JavaScript share the data types, strings, integers, floats, arrays, booleans, have similar syntax when expressing these data types, and share in a few built-in methods that are invoked using dot notation. 
		</p>
		<p>
		One, big difference between Ruby and JavaScript comes in the use and implementation of objects.In Ruby, objects are instances of classes.
        You've spent four weeks learning Ruby and getting to know its powerful built-in methods. How was your experience learning JavaScript?Identify one fundamental difference between how Ruby and JavaScript do something, and teach your audience about it. There are many ways you can look at this. Here are some ideas:

- Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects
- Ruby classes vs. JavaScript constructor functions
- Ruby documentation vs. JavaScript documentation
- Looping in Ruby vs. Looping in JavaScript

		</p>
        <p>
        Write a blog (or create a video to present on your blog) where you teach your audience the difference you identified between JavaScript and Ruby.

        Global variables start with a $ symbol. No matter where they are declared they can be accessed.
