    <h2>Javascript: Objects with no Class</h2>
    <h4>Saturday, February 7, 2015</h4>
    <section>
		<p>
        This week we delved into front-end programming with JavaScript! It was a surprising, yet welcomed change. Our time with Ruby certainly helped out with learning the basics of JavaScript. Ruby and JavaScript share the data types, strings, integers, floats, arrays, and booleans, have similar syntax when expressing these data types, and share in a few built-in methods that are invoked using dot notation.
		</p>
		<p>
		One, big difference between Ruby and JavaScript comes in the use and implementation of objects. In Ruby, objects are instances of a class. You can define a class using the keyword "class" followed by a block of code detailing the behavior of the class. To gain access to this behavior, calling new on the class, an instance of the class is initialized and assigned to a variable. This variable is an object of type "className". 
		</p>
        <p>
        Objects in JavaScript are not instances of a class. There are no classes in JavaScript. JavaScript objects are more closely related to Ruby hashes. Like with every other data type in JavaScript, you initialize an object using the "var" keyword followed by the object name, an equal sign, and curly braces. Yes, using the same symbol as Ruby hashes. Within those curly braces, you set an object property equal to a value. This notation is very similar to symbol, value pairs in Ruby hashes. Then property name is followed by a colon and then the property value. This value can be anything, from an interger to another object. 
        </p>
		To access object properties, the object name is used followed by a dot and the property name. Ex: objectName.propertyName => propertyValue This is similar to how Ruby instance or class variables are accessed. You can also access the property using the object name followed by the property name in quotes and inside square brackets. Ex: objectName[propertyName] => propertyValue. This is similar to hash value access using the key.
        <p>
        So, when you're questioning the behaviour of an object in JavaScript, just remember they have no class.
