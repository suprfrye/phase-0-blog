    <h2>Embracing Values</h2>
    <h4>Saturday, February 7, 2015</h4>
    <section>
		<p>
		Thinking back to the times in my life when Iâ€™ve been the
        happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, these values come to mind: accomplished, enthusiastic, excited, inspired, helping others, collaborative, alive, free, confident, authentic, powerful, vibrant, harmonious, insightful, evolving, expressive.
		</p>
		<p>
		Below is a table of my commitment to these values in my daily life. <br>

        Authenticity is super important to me. It's somethin I've struggled with. But, I know once I'm living it, life will be much more meaningful and much more fulfilling.

		The last topic someone came to me for advise had to do with communication, more specifically navigating a situation so that the other party felt at ease and open to continue the conversation and hopefully resolve the issue.

		How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?

        Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?
