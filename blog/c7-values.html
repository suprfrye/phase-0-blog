    <h2>Embracing Values</h2>
    <h4>Saturday, February 7, 2015</h4>
    <section>
		<p>
		Thinking back to the times in my life when Iâ€™ve been the
        happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, these values come to mind: accomplished, enthusiastic, excited, inspired, helping others, collaborative, alive, free, confident, authentic, powerful, vibrant, harmonious, insightful, evolving, expressive.
		</p>
		<p>
		Below is a table of my commitment to these values in my daily life. <br>

        Authenticity is super important to me. It's somethin I've struggled with. I think we've all struggled to some degree or another to balance the reception of all of these outside influences and expectations against our singular tastes and desires. But, I know once I'm living it, life will be much more meaningful and much more fulfilling.

        Interestingly, the last topic someone came to me for advise had to do with communication , more specifically navigating a situation so that the other party felt at ease and open to continue the conversation and hopefully resolve the issue. Which is strange because I don't consider myself a good communicator, but communication can be seen as a combination of expression and insight, a couple of the values from the above table.

        I know that everyone has some set of values. And, some are usually as vague as family, education, and religion, but this exercise has certainly helped me pinpoint values, really specific expressions, that I did not know I held. These values make me feel good. It also helps me on my path to living one of my most esteemed values, authenticity.

        Here is how living with a few a my values in mind can help combat stereotype threat.
        <ul>
            <li>Feeling <em>free</em> from the weight of carrying a whole culture's or community's progress and reputation.</li>
            <li><em>Expressing</em> my feelings and contributing input.</li>
            <li>Being <em>confident</em> in my abilities and my capability to manuever within my environment.</li>
        </ul>
        Keeping my values in mind coupled with taking adequate breaks and an exercise regiment should help when I'm feeling down at DBC. And if need be, a dance break always seems to lift the mood ;)
