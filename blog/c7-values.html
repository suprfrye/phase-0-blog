		When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the
happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following
values come to mind?
		</p>
		<p>
		In general, I try to live up to these values:

Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
		</p>
        <p>
       Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you.

        </p>
		<p>
		What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?
		</p>
		<p>
		How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?

Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?

        Global variables start with a $ symbol. No matter where they are declared they can be accessed. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Which variable type to use depends on your needs. But, as a rule it is best to avoid using global variables. Because of their large scope and accessibility it is harder to monitor changes.
