    <h2>Git Acquainted with the Command Line</h2>

      It has been a bumpy start. But, I have fallen in love with the command line. Telling the computer what to do through commands makes me feel like a computer wiz, a super hacker!
      </p>
      <p>
      For those of you who don't know what the command line is, it is a way to navigate and interact with the computer by typing a 'command' into the Terminal. You can access everything on the computer from this one window, and usually with just one line! This takes the place of using the mouse or searching through the File Explorer or Finder to locate a file or application and opening and manipulating it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Which brings me to git, version control, and GitHub. Git and GitHub are tools to help facilitate version control. Git is software local to your computer that allows you to create various versions of content as your content develops. This helps to keep track of changes, allows you to revert to a specifc version of your content, and also allows mutiple people to work on the same content and later merge these versions into one. To help with collaborations, feedback, or simply to have remote access to your content, using the command line you can push these versions of your content to a hosting site like GitHub where anyone can have access to it.
      </p>
      <p>
      So there it is! It's the first week of Phase 0 at DevBootcamp, and I already feel technically empowered by using the command line and getting familiar with git and GitHub as version control tools.
