    <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
    <h4>Sunday, February 1, 2015</h4>

		Stereotype threat has shaped most of my formative years. From middle school where my blackness or lack thereof was brought up, to high school where being black and of a lower socioeconomic class were what I was pushing against. What I also notice now is that it does not matter if you actually belong to or identify with a social identity. Stereotype threat can also affect you even if you are perceived as belonging to a particular group as with gender identity, sexual orientation, race, and religion.

        It is really hard to get around stereotypes. Stereotypes have affected us all at one time or other, experiences that we bring along with us to each environment we enter. Planning how to combat the feeling of stereotype threat is difficult. First, I would identify the triggers. Why am I feeling this? What brought on these feelings? Then I would address these triggers and talk through disarming them. And, lastly I would put the task in perspective as simply something that needs to be done and nothing more, while also encouraging personal ability and effort.
        </p>

		To combat stereotype threat it is so important that everyone is comfortable in an environment. Acknowledging individuals immediately, valuing and encouraging input, and having open and honest communication help to create a more welcoming environment, and thereby hopefully limiting feelings of stereotype threat.
