    <h2>Ruby Variable Scope</h2>
    <h4>Sunday, February 1, 2015</h4>
    <section>
		<p>
		There are five types of variables in Ruby: local, instance, class, constant, and global. Each variable type has a different scope, or jurisdiction. Variable types are distinguished using symbols. Ex: local variable => local_variable, instance variable => @instance_variable, class variable => @@class_variable, constant => Constant/CONSTANT, global => $global_variable.
		</p>
		<p>
		Local variables begin with a lowercase letter or an underscore. They can only be referenced from within the area they are defined. Ex: main, method, loop
		</p>
        <p>
        Instance variables begin with an @ symbol. They are defined within a class and are accessible only for a specific instance of the class. Ex: 
        </p>
		<p>
		Class variables begin with two @ symbols. They are defined within a class and are accessible for every instance of the class. If the class variable changes, this change will affect every instance of the class. Ex:
		</p>
		<p>
		Constants begin with a capital letter. When a constant is declared within a class or method, it is accessible from anywhere within the class or method. If a constant is declared in main or the module it is accessible to all components of the module. In this way it acts like a global variable. But, unlike a global variable when you modify a constant, a warning will display informing you of the change. 
		</p> 
        <p>
        Global variables start with a $ symbol. No matter where they are declared they can be accessed. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Which variable type to use depends on your needs. But, as a rule it is best to avoid using global variables. Because of their large scope and accessibility it is harder to monitor changes.
