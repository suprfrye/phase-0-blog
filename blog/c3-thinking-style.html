		<p>
		These first three weeks of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp, my biggest struggle has been time management. I have not been accountabale to the time blocks I set in Week 1. In Week 3 I did begin to turn things around and at least time my reflections to a maximum of fifteen minutes. The longer amount of time I spend on each chapter is due to my concern to consume everything so that later, when I come across it again, a spark will ignite and it'll be retained. In Unit 2, I will wholeheartedly stick to my time blocks, adjusting them as necessary for the magnitude and technicality of the chapters. This should give me better practice in estimating the length of time required to complete future projects.
		</p>
		<p>		
    In Unit 2, throughout Dev Bootcamp, and beyond, I will acknowledge the fear, doubt, or trepidation, and push beyond and simply <em>do</em> my best. Most of my discomfort lies in the social aspect of DBC. It is three weeks in and I have yet to pair with anyone from my cohort, so I'm still not feeling quite connected. As getting past this will only help my growth, I will be more personal and direct, and send email requests for pairing rather than post in Communities.
		</p>
		<p>
		I look forward to the positive impact these changes will have on my experience at DBC.
